# CMS Built with Laravel + React + Inertia.js + Shadcn

This project is a modern Content Management System (CMS) built using **Laravel** for the backend, **React** for the frontend, and **Inertia.js** for SPA-like performance without the complexity of building a separate API.  
The UI is powered by **Shadcn**, offering clean, accessible, and customizable components.  
It also includes a visual **UI Builder** to help users easily design components with drag-and-drop WYSIWYG functionality.
